Pure Javascript  News Website by using News Api

## NewsApi
News API is a simple HTTP REST API for searching and retrieving live articles from all over the web. It can help you answer questions like:
*What top stories is the NY Times running right now?
*What new articles were published about the next iPhone today?
*Has my company or product been mentioned or reviewed by any blogs recently?
You need an API key to use the API - this is a unique key that identifies your requests. They're free for development, open-source, and non-commercial use.
